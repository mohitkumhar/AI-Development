    "# <center>Curse of Dimensionality</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Curse of Dimensionality** happens when you have too many features (or variables) in a dataset. As the number of features grows, it creates problems for machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Becomes Sparse**: With more features, data points spread out, and it becomes harder for models to find patterns.\n",
    "2. **Overfitting**: Models may learn too much from the training data, including noise, leading to poor performance on new data.\n",
    "3. **Distance Between Points Loses Meaning**: In high dimensions, the distances between points become less informative.\n",
    "4. **Increased Computation**: More features mean more time, memory, and computing power is needed to process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality Reduction** helps reduce the number of features while keeping the important information. This helps deal with the curse of dimensionality, improves model performance, and makes it easier to visualize and understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to reduce dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection**  \n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection is about choosing the most important features from the original data and ignoring the less useful ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter Methods**: These use statistical tests to select important features.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Using correlation to see which features are related to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper Methods**: These test different combinations of features and select the best set based on model performance.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) removes the least important features one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedded Methods**: Some models automatically select important features during training.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Lasso regression (a type of linear model) picks important features while training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction creates new features from the original ones by transforming the data into a simpler form, while still keeping most of the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Feature Extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA reduces the number of features by creating new ones that explain most of the data's variation.\n",
    "  - **Example**: If there are many similar features, PCA combines them into fewer, more meaningful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: LDA reduces dimensions by finding the best way to separate different classes (used for classification tasks).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: t-SNE is mainly used to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D, showing patterns or clusters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Autoencoders (Neural Networks)**: Autoencoders are a type of neural network that compresses data into a smaller form and then tries to rebuild it, keeping the most important features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**: MDS reduces dimensions by preserving the distances between data points as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**: ICA separates data into independent components, used for problems like separating mixed signals.\n",

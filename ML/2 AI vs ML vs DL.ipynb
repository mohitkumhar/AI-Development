    "# Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "AI is a broad area that involves making machines smart so they can do things that normally require human intelligence. This includes anything that helps computers act like humans, solve complex problems, and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "ML is a part of AI that focuses on creating algorithms that let computers learn from data. Instead of being given step-by-step instructions for every task, ML systems get better at tasks over time by analyzing data and finding patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "DL is a part of ML that uses special algorithms called neural networks, which have many layers, to look at different aspects of data. It's especially good at tasks like recognizing images and understanding speech. DL needs a lot of data and computer power to work well.\n"

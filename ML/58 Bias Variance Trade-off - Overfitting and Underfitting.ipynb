    "- **Bias**: Bias refers to error due to overly simplistic models. A model with high bias may **underfit**, meaning it’s not learning the patterns well from the training data, leading to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Example**: Imagine trying to predict house prices based only on square footage. If you ignore other factors like location, age of the house, etc., your model will likely give inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Advantage of high bias**: Simple and fast models.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantage**: Poor accuracy on both training and unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance**: Variance refers to error due to models being too complex and too sensitive to noise in the training data. A model with high variance may **overfit**, meaning it performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Example**: A model that tries to predict house prices by fitting to every small fluctuation in the data (like the color of walls) is overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Advantage of high variance**: Good performance on training data.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantage**: Poor generalization to new data.\n",

    "### Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: When the model is too complex and fits not only the true pattern but also noise in the training data (high variance, low bias). It leads to poor performance on new data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Solution**: Simplify the model, regularization, more data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: When the model is too simple and fails to capture the pattern in the data (high bias, low variance). It leads to poor performance on both training and new data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Solution**: Increase model complexity, use more features.\n",

    "### The Goal:\n",
    "Find the **right balance** between bias and variance to create a model that performs well on both training and unseen data. This is the essence of the **bias-variance trade-off**.\n",

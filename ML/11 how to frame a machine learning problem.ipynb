    "### How to Frame a Machine Learning Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Problem to ML Problem**\n",
    "   - Convert the business goal into a specific machine learning task. For example, if the goal is to reduce customer churn, frame it as a task to predict which customers are likely to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type of Problem**\n",
    "   - Identify the type of machine learning problem. Is it classification (e.g., spam detection), regression (e.g., price prediction), clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), or something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Current Solution**\n",
    "   - Look at the existing solution. How is the problem being handled now? Understand its limitations and why a machine learning approach could be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Getting Data**\n",
    "   - Collect data that is relevant to the problem. This may involve gathering existing data, scraping data from the web, or collecting new data through surveys or experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Metrics to Measure**\n",
    "   - Define how you will measure the success of your model. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error. Choose metrics that align with your business goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Online vs. Batch?**\n",
    "   - Decide whether the model needs to make real-time predictions (online) or if it can process data in large chunks at intervals (batch). This affects how you build and deploy the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Check Assumptions**\n",
    "   - Verify any assumptions you have about the data and the problem. For example, ensure that the data is representative of the problem you're trying to solve and that the chosen model assumptions hold true in your context.\n"

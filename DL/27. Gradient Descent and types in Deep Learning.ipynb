    "# 🚀 Types of Gradient Descent: Advantages & Disadvantages  \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is a method used to minimize the loss in machine learning. There are three main types:  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ **Batch Gradient Descent**  \n",
    "**📝 How it works:** Uses the entire dataset to update weights after every step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Advantages:**  \n",
    "- **Stable updates** → Less noise, smooth convergence.  \n",
    "- **Efficient for convex problems** → Works well when there’s only one minimum.  \n",
    "- **Uses matrix operations** → Faster on small datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "- **Slow for large datasets** → Takes too long when data is huge.  \n",
    "- **High memory usage** → Needs to store all data.  \n",
    "- **Can get stuck in local minima** → Not great for complex problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**  \n",
    "**📝 How it works:** Updates weights after every single data point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Advantages:**  \n",
    "- **Fast updates** → Learns quickly.  \n",
    "- **Works well for large datasets** → Doesn't need all data at once.  \n",
    "- **Can escape local minima** → Good for complex problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "- **Noisy updates** → Can jump around instead of smoothly decreasing.  \n",
    "- **Harder to tune** → Learning rate must be adjusted properly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**  \n",
    "**📝 How it works:** Uses small groups (mini-batches) of data to update weights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Advantages:**  \n",
    "- **Balances speed and stability** → Faster than Batch GD, smoother than SGD.  \n",
    "- **Works well with GPUs** → Efficient for deep learning.  \n",
    "- **Uses less memory** → Handles big datasets better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "- **Still needs tuning** → Batch size affects performance.  \n",
    "- **Not as fast as pure SGD** → But still better than Batch GD.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔥 **Which One Should You Use?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Best Gradient Descent Type |\n",
    "|----------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Small dataset | **Batch Gradient Descent** |\n",
    "| Large dataset | **Mini-Batch GD or SGD** |\n",
    "| Need fast updates | **Mini-Batch GD** |\n",
    "| Complex problem | **SGD (escapes local minima better)** |\n",
    "| Deep learning (GPU) | **Mini-Batch GD** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "- **Batch GD** → Best for small datasets, smooth convergence.  \n",
    "- **SGD** → Best for large datasets and escaping bad local minima.  \n",
    "- **Mini-Batch GD** → Best of both worlds, commonly used in deep learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most widely used method today!**  \n"

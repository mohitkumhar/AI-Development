    "## How Dropout Works\n",
    "- During training, dropout randomly deactivates (drops) a fraction of neurons in a layer.\n",
    "- This means some neurons are ignored in each training step, making the network rely on different neurons each time.\n",
    "- As a result, the model does not become too dependent on specific neurons and learns more generalized patterns."
